Over the past few years, I've specialized in backend development, systems integration, and data engineering. I‚Äôve developed robust APIs, created bots for issuing electronic invoices and paying taxes, and integrated with municipal services through SOAP web services‚Äîbringing stability to processes and preventing delays in fiscal and financial deliveries.

In cities where no API was available, I engineered web scrapers using **Selenium**, allowing our solution to support more cities and reach more potential customers.

I‚Äôve developed backend services using Python frameworks such as **Django**, **FastAPI**, **Sanic**, and **Flask**, always following industry best practices and optimizing for maintainability, performance, and security.

Some key accomplishments in my career include:

- üöÄ Reduced API response time **by more than 10x** with Docker containerization and backend improvements.
- üí∞ Decreased infrastructure costs while enhancing deployment speed and control with **CI/CD and Docker**.
- üß† Identified patterns in raw telemetry data from connected vehicles at **Ford**, which led to predictive insights into critical failures. I used **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Pandas** in this project.
- üåê Designed a real-time **monitoring system using AWS (EC2), InfluxDB, and Chronograf** for luxury condominium access control. It integrated camera systems, vehicle plate recognition, and facial ID to anticipate failures and bugs‚Äîresulting in higher client satisfaction and faster issue resolution.

I also had the opportunity to be mentored by the CEO of my company, a former IBM engineer, who taught me architectural and coding best practices that I carry with me today.

With over 6 years of Python experience, I continue to be passionate about building resilient systems, scaling backend services, and enabling data-driven solutions.

Feel free to connect or collaborate‚ÄîI'm always open to new challenges and innovations.
