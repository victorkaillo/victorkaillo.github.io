I hold a degree in Computer Engineering from UFRN (Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte). I'm a native Portuguese speaker and fluent in English. I'm passionate about technology, problem-solving, and building solutions that make a real difference in people’s lives.

Beyond the technical world, I'm an enthusiastic and naturally optimistic person. I love making people laugh and bringing joy wherever I go. Humor and lightheartedness are part of how I connect with others, both personally and professionally.

I'm deeply spiritual—reading the Bible and studying about God and His creation are essential parts of my routine. I enjoy reflecting on life through faith and learning from biblical teachings.

In my free time, I like practicing sports (even if I'm not sure I'm good at them!), exploring different music styles, and traveling. I'm family-oriented and cherish every moment I get to spend with my wife—she’s my greatest partner and source of joy.
