I study engineering (graduating in “Computer Engineering”) in UFRN (Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte).
My native language is Portuguese. I am an enthusiastic, self- motivated, reliable and responsible. However, I am irreverent, aweless, daring, audacious and happy. I like to make people happy. I love to put laughs on every face. I’m a nice fun and friendly person. My hobby is read the bible. I like to study about God and the natural beauty. I read a lot about everything involving God and his son Jesus.
I enjoy all the sports you can practice. But I do not know if I'm good at any of them. I enjoy many musical styles.
I love my family and I love travel with my family. I spent most of my time with my wife and I'm loving it.
